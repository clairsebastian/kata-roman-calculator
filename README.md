### Pre-req for working on the app

This app was built and tested on a Unix(Mac OS) machine based on Apple M1 pro Hardware. The app was built using Typescript and uses Node as the runtime env. The app uses NPM as the package manager. We are using Vite test runner to directly unit test the typescript files.

Please make sure you have the following installed in your local dev machine before running the tests and code

Node Version -> v18.14.0
[Install NodeJs from here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

NPM version -> 9.4.2

Typescript Version -> 4.9.5 (will be installed by npm install)


### Instructions to run the code

```
npm install  // To install all the packages
npm test // Run the tests with the coverage report generated.
npm start // To start the simulation. The result will be printed in console

```
